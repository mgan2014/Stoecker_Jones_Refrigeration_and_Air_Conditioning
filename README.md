This repository contains solutions to all problems (up to Chapter 18 with Chapter 1 Introduction and Chapter 17 Absorption Refrigeration skipped) from Refrigeration and Air Conditioning (2nd edition, 1982) by Stoecker and Jones. The solutions are implemented using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) from F-Chart Software. The aim is to assist engineers and students in understanding the fundamentals of Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration (HVAC&R) through computational problem-solving.
