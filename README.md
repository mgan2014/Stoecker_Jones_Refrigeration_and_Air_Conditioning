This repository contains solutions to all problems (up to Chapter 16) from Refrigeration and Air Conditioning (2nd edition, 1982) by Stoecker and Jones. The solutions are implemented using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) from F-Chart Software. The aim is to assist engineers and students in understanding the fundamentals of Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration (HVAC&R) through computational problem-solving.
